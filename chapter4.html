        <p>Han Jue and Xing Hongxuan arrived at a deserted corner of the forest. Han Jue felt uneasy, fearing that Xing Hongxuan would make… that request.</p><p>Xing Hongxuan turned to look at him with a burning gaze.</p><p>Han Jue didn’t dare to look her in the eyes.</p><p>Xing Hongxuan smiled and said, “Don’t be nervous. I’m not trying to bother you. I just want to ask you, are you really willing to be a slave in this herbal garden forever?”</p><p>Han Jue was silent.</p><p><em>Next, you want me to bow before you and become your toy?</em></p><p>Xing Hongxuan took a step forward and whispered into his ear, “Help me do something. I will help you cultivate and rid you of your mortal identity.”</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>Xing Hongxuan opened and closed her mouth, but no sound came out. However, Han Jue heard her clearly.</p><p>“Help me obtain Elder Iron’s alchemy recipe. I will bring you along when I leave the Jade Pure Sect and we will head to the Fiendish Cult. I will treat you well in the future. Under me, you will not suffer at all. If you have the aptitude and achieve good cultivation, we can even become companions.”</p><p>Sound transmission!</p><p>Han Jue widened his eyes.</p><p><em>This woman is actually a fiendish cultivator!</em></p><p>Han Jue had no idea what to do.</p><p>This was no joke. If he agreed, he would offend the entire Jade Pure Sect.</p><p>If he refused, Xing Hongxuan would never let him leave the forest.</p><p>Elder Iron wasn’t here. This was only the outer sect of the Jade Pure Sect. No one would respond even if he shouted his lungs out.</p><p>Xing Hongxuan didn’t rush him. She walked around Han Jue and waited patiently.</p><p>Han Jue was weighing his chances of winning against Xing Hongxuan.</p><p>They were both at the seventh level of the Qi Refinement realm. Without magic and equipment, how could he defeat Xing Hongxuan?</p><p><em>I can’t resort to brute force.</em></p><p>Han Jue pretended to be terrified and said, “I don’t know where that thing is. Moreover, Zhang Ge is there…”</p><p>Xing Hongxuan looked satisfied. The fact that Han Jue didn’t mention the alchemy recipe meant that he was smart.</p><p>“It’s alright. I still have time. I can wait for you,” Xing Hongxuan said with a smile.</p><p>She took out a pill and said, “This pill can help you unlock your cultivation potential. Take it, this is my greeting gift.”</p><p>Han Jue looked at the pill. It looked like chocolate.</p><div class="HWEzrjgt bBcZeWug" data-defid="60dde6022181c862ff65a353" data-mobid="60dde5e82181c862ff65a351"></div><p>It was definitely poison!</p><p>Not able to refuse, Han Jue placed it in his mouth.</p><p>But he wrapped the pill with his spirit Qi to prevent it from melting.</p><p>After swallowing it, Han Jue opened his mouth and deliberately showed it to Xing Hongxuan. He then said excitedly, “Thank you, fairy-like miss! I will do my best!”</p><p>Damn it!</p><p><em>Wait for me to cultivate for another year and I will let you know how formidable I am!</em></p><p>It was impossible for Han Jue to join the Fiendish Cult just like that.</p><p>He wanted to live forever, not a risky life.</p><p>Xing Hongxuan covered her mouth and smiled. She reached out to touch Han Jue’s cheek and said with a smile, “You’re so sensible. Be good. I will groom you as my husband in the future.”</p><p>Han Jue showed excitement.</p><p>But he was actually disgusted.</p><p><em>Stupid bitch, do you think you are worthy of me?</em></p><p>Xing Hongxuan rubbed his face for a while more before the two of them returned to the herb garden.</p><p>The male cultivator looked at Han Jue suspiciously, frowning.</p><p>Xing Hongxuan smiled mysteriously and continued her cultivation.</p><p>As Han Jue walked into the herb garden, lines of words suddenly appeared before his eyes.</p><p>[You were threatened by the fiendish cultivator Xing Hongxuan. You have the following choices.]</p><p><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup></p><p><em>Eh?</em></p><p><em>I can even be rewarded?</em></p><p><em>Nice!</em></p><p>Han Jue’s eyes lit up.</p><p>He was even more determined to not listen to her.</p><div class="HWEzrjgt bBcZeWug" data-defid="60dde6022181c862ff65a353" data-mobid="60dde5e82181c862ff65a351"></div><p>…</p><p>Night fell…</p><p>Han Jue returned to the room and activated the barrier function.</p><p>He then spat out the pill in his stomach and placed it in his belt.</p><p>Then, he walked to the wooden bed and sat down. He took out a steamed bun and started eating.</p><p>He had already abstained from eating ordinary meals, but to not cause suspicion, he had to pretend to eat.</p><p>It was late at night.</p><p>After the five slaves had fallen asleep, Han Jue continued to cultivate.</p><p>Given his cultivation potential, it wouldn’t be difficult for him to surpass Xing Hongxuan.</p><p>For the next few days, Han Jue worked as usual.</p><p>Zhang Ge had been cultivating in Elder Iron’s residence, giving Han Jue an excuse to not enter.</p><p>Xing Hongxuan seemed to be in no hurry.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a year had passed.</p><p>[Name: Han Jue]</p><p>[Lifespan: 18 / 85]</p><p>[Race: Mortal]</p><p>[Cultivation: 8th level of the Qi Refinement Realm]</p><p>[Technique: Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique (Can be inherited)]</p><p>[Magic: None]</p><p>[Mystical Power: None]</p><p>[Equipment: None]</p><p>[Cultivation Potential: Spiritual Physique of the Six Paths. It contains top-notch wind, fire, water, earth, wood, and thunder cultivation potentials. Increases providence to a certain extent.]</p><p>[Connate Providence is as follows]</p><p>[Unparalleled: Immortal beauty, top-notch charm]</p><p>[Destined Sword Fanatic: Top-notch Sword Dao aptitude, top-notch Sword Dao learning ability]</p><p>[Unparalleled Movement Technique: Top-notch movement technique aptitude]</p><p>[Descendant of the Immortal Emperor: After the game begins, you will receive an unparalleled cultivation technique and 1,000 superior-grade spirit stones.]</p><div class="HWEzrjgt bBcZeWug" data-defid="60dde6022181c862ff65a353" data-mobid="60dde5e82181c862ff65a351"></div><p>[Check interpersonal relationships]</p><p>…</p><p>Han Jue broke through to the eighth level of Qi Refinement Realm, and all four of his spiritual roots reached the eighth level of Qi Refinement Realm.</p><p>It was worth mentioning that his lifespan had also increased by twenty years, making him overjoyed.</p><p>The feeling of having his spiritual Qi rapidly grow was truly wonderful.</p><p>On the other hand, Xing Hongxuan and Elder Iron hadn’t progressed in their cultivation at all.</p><p>This was the difference between a genius and a mortal.</p><p>Han Jue was secretly pleased.</p><p>Indeed, one had to endure loneliness to become stronger.</p><p>If he had started cultivating as a mortal from the very beginning, he might not even have reached the fourth level of the Qi Refinement Realm yet.</p><p>That night.</p><p>Han Jue heard footsteps outside the door. He immediately lay down and closed the barrier.</p><p>“I’m going to lure Zhang Ge away. You can go in and look for the item later.”</p><p>Xing Hongxuan’s voice reached Han Jue’s ears.</p><p>He opened his eyes and hurriedly got up.</p><p><em>Damn.</em></p><p><em>I still can’t run away from it.</em></p><p>Han Jue waited patiently.</p><p>He, who was at the eighth level of Qi Refining, had already obtained a divine sense, and his normal senses were also extraordinary.</p><p>He could faintly hear the sound of tables and chairs colliding in the distant pavilion.</p><p>“You can go now.”</p><p>Xing Hongxuan’s voice flowed into his ear. Then, Han Jue sensed Xing Hongxuan and Zhang Ge rushing away from the roof.</p><p>Han Jue quietly got up and prepared to put on a show.</p><p>After carefully leaving the house, he looked towards the entrance of the herb garden and discovered that the male cultivator had fallen under a tree. He couldn’t tell if the guy was dead or alive.</p><p>“What a weak guy.”</p><div class="HWEzrjgt bBcZeWug" data-defid="60dde6022181c862ff65a353" data-mobid="60dde5e82181c862ff65a351"></div><p>Han Jue couldn’t help but ridicule him.</p><p>He headed for the pavilion.</p><p>Elder Iron’s pavilion was two stories high, just like the villa. It was grand and magnificent, filled with all kinds of porcelain and paintings. After Han Jue entered the house, he began to wander around.</p><p>He didn’t put in any effort at all.</p><p>Even if there was something he wanted, he had no place to keep it.</p><p>After sitting for half an hour, Han Jue got up and continued to rummage through the drawers. He had to at least put on an act.</p><p>Another half an hour passed.</p><p>Xing Hongxuan returned.</p><p>She rushed into the room and found him. “Have you found it?”</p><p>Standing beside a vase, Han Jue turned around and said, “I couldn’t find it. I searched everywhere but couldn’t find it.”</p><p>All of a sudden, he noticed that Xing Hongxuan was covered in blood.</p><p>Had she killed Zhang Ge?</p><p>Han Jue retreated subconsciously and accidentally knocked over the vase on the table.</p><p>Ping—</p><p>The vase fell to the floor and shattered.</p><p>Han Jue saw a manual appearing in the broken vase with two words carved on it.</p><p>Alchemy recipe.</p><p>Silence!</p><p>The room was so quiet that a dropping needle would have been heard.</p><p>Han Jue was stunned and felt extremely awkward.</p><p><em>Erm…</em></p><p><em>Damn it!</em></p><p><em>Is this how Elder Iron hides his things?</em></p><p>Xing Hongxuan shifted her gaze from the alchemy recipe to him. It looked as if there was a bottomless abyss in her eyes.</p><p>Han Jue said in surprise, “He actually hid it in a vase. This old man really knows how to hide things!”</p>
